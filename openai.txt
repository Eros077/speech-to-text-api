This project requires sending requests to two OpenAI 
models APIs: Whisper and ChatGPT.

To use these APIs, you need to create an OpenAI account and obtain an 
API key. Please note that there is a cost associated with using the OpenAI 
services, but it is relatively affordable.

To get started, you can visit the OpenAI website and sign up for an account. 
Once you have your account set up, you will need to generate an API key. 
The OpenAI documentation provides detailed instructions on how to obtain 
the API key and how to use it to make API requests.

I recommend referring to the OpenAI documentation for more information on 
using the Whisper and ChatGPT models and how to integrate them into your 
project.
