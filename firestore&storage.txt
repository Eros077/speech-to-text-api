This project utilizes Firebase, a Google Backend as a Service (BaaS) 
platform. Firebase is used for the database, specifically Firestore for 
data storage and Firebase Storage for storing audio files.

The API endpoint receives a JSON payload in the following format:
{
    "elderly_id": "Mi8vipcv6oyLMZk8ZauU",
    "audio_url": "https://theAudioUrl.com/storage/audio3.mp3",
    "email": "example@email.com"
}

In Firestore:
    - Create a collection named "elderlyUsers" with at least one document. 
    The name of the document corresponds to the user ID.
    - Within the document, there must be at least one field with the key 
    "residenceId" and its value is the name of the corresponding document 
    in the "residences" collection.
    - Create a collection named "residences" with at least one document.
    - Create a collection named "interviews" (which can be empty).

In Firebase Storage:
    - Ensure you have a Firebase Storage project set up. 
    - Upload an audio file and obtain its URL.

After completing these steps (and having the API running, at least on 
localhost), you're ready to make a request with the aforementioned 
JSON payload in the request body.
